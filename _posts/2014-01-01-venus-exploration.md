title: Venus Exploration
description: Venus is the second planet from the sun, and often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to the similarity in size. The planet rotates on its axis more slowly than any other planet, so slow that one Venutian year is about 1.92 Venutian days long, and the Venutian day is about 243 Earth days long.
